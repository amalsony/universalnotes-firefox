# UniversalNotes Review Notes

Thank you for reviewing UniversalNotes.

## Environment

I used the following environment and version to compile UniversalNotes:

1. Operating System: `macOS Sonoma 14.0`
2. NodeJS version: `20.9.0`
3. NPM version: `10.1.0`

## How to build UniversalNotes

To recreate the final extension, please run the following commands:

1. Install packages: `npm install`
2. Build the extension: `npm run build`

The extension and manifest will be in the `dist` folder.

## Additional Info

For the extension to function, it needs to have permission to access data in the universalnotes.org domain. Instructions to enable this are communicated to the user upon opening the extension, and clicking the `Get Started` button.

An optional account allows the user to add notes and vote on them. An account can be created with the "Continue with Google" button.
